        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Philippine adobo is a Spanish-influenced meat dish consisting of a tangy sauce of vinegar, garlic, soy sauce and black pepper. Vinegar is a common ingredient found in many Filipino dishes and it is s one of the main ingredients in any adobo.</p>
        <p>Some may regard Adobo to be the national dish of the Philippines because it is so popular.

It is called white adobo. </p>
